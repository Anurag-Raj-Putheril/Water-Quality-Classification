# Water-Quality-Classification
Anurag Raj Putheril

AIM OF THE PROJECT

To classify the quality of water based on its physicochemical properties using various predictive models, compare them and find the best model for the purpose.

INFERENCE

SVM and Logistic Regression are the best models, with SVM being the better of the two.

# Water-Quality-Classification

AIM OF THE PROJECT

To classify the quality of water based on its physicochemical properties using various predictive models, compare them and find the best model for the purpose.

INFERENCE

The tried out SVM model has less accuracy (0.74) than the Random forest classifier (0.79)
